  "body": "### Welcome Spring HATEOAS Forms.\r\nThis library implements a common API for creating HATEOAS output in different implementations, like HAL, HAL-Forms, Syren, XHTML, etc. Additionally its API allows to define FORMS that are consumable by HATEOAS clients so that the restrictions of the expected inputs are formally defined\r\n\r\n### Integrations\r\nThis library can be integrated transparently with traditional Spring HATEOAS projects and also with Spring Data REST projects (even though the complete implementation it is still a work in progress).\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nIn 2016, Gotzon Illarramendi (@gillaramendi), Xabier Aldama (@xaldama), and Joseba Ander Ruiz (@anderruiz) founded HATEOAS Forms.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with the library?
